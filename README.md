# My C Attempt at the [Cryptopals Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/)

## Setup
- [x] Start project file structure
- [x] Makefiles and compilation testing
- [ ] Init .git
- [ ] Github!
- [ ] Checklist done! Delete it!

## The Fun Part:

	> Ill be writing in C and compiling with gcc
		>> I get to relearn how to fight GNU Make!
		>> I should also brush up on my pure C syntax . . .

## Some Conventions

	File Names: PascalCase
